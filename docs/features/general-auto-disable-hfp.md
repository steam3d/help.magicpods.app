## Auto disable Handsfree

!!! note
    Changing this option will affect on [Show battery percentage](../features/general-show-battery-percentage.md) if headphone supports it.

The hands-free service or profile is used for voice communication. All Bluetooth headphones have very poor sound and microphone quality when used in this mode. (You can get slightly better quality with certain Bluetooth adapters.)
