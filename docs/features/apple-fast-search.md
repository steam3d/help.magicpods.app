## Fast search

Speeds up headphones searching time and ear detection (where supported). Switch this setting on only when no one else around you is using the same headphone model as yours.

Fast search is affected by the [AirPods search radius](../fun-popup-animation.md) parameter.  The data of the headphones within this search radius will be used for the functions: charge level, ear detection.

> If there are two or more the same headphone model in the search radius, the accuracy of the data may be reduced.
