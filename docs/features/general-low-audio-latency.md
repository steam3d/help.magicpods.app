## Low audio latency

!!! note
    Some Bluetooth drivers have already fixed this problem. If you do not experience a difference, disable this feature.

Reduces the delay between frequent switching on (play) and off (pause) of the sound. Useful when working in Premiere Pro or Audition. The feature can increase battery consumption because it prevents the headphones from going into standby mode.
