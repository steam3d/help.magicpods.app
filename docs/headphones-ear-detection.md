Some headphone models support Ear Detection which allows you to automatically pause and resume playing media content when you remove and insert the earphone into your ear.

## Play / Pause

Description:

1. Insert both headphones in ears to activate Ear Detection
2. Remove one headphone from your ear to pause playback
3. Insert the one headphone back into your ear to resume playback
4. Remove both headphones from your ears to pause playback. MagicPods will wait 60 seconds, after this time the Ear Detection feature will be deactivated. Repeat `Step 1` to activate Ear Detection
