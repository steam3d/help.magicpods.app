# Bluetooth Low Energy not supported

There are 3 reasons for this error:

1. Bluetooth Dongle has Bluetooth version below 4.0
2. The windows doesn't allow access to Bluetooth

## Bluetooth Dongle has Bluetooth version below 4.0

Any AirPods required Bluetooth 4.0 and above. Check your bluetooth version if it is lower, then the only way is to change Bluetooth module.

## The windows doesn't allow access to Bluetooth

Usually those steeps can help:

- Restart the app
- Turn off / on bluetooth
- Reboot your PC
- Try update bluetooth drivers
