For unknown reason Windows do not allow working with bluetooth and reboot doesn't help.

### Solution

1. Close the MagicPods
2. Open `Task Manager` and terminate `MagicPodsService.exe` and `MagicPodsUI.exe` if they still work
3. Uninstall the MagicPods
4. `Important!` Reboot your PC
5. Install MagicPods

Usefully steeps above must help.
