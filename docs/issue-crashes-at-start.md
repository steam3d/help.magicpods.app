# Ð¡rashes at start

If app immediately crashes at start. Thx our community for this guid.

### Solution
1. Right click on your `C:\` drive and select `Properties`
2. Go to the `Security` tab and click `Edit`
3. Select `Add`. In the text box asking for object names, type `ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES`
4. Press `OK`, then select the new entry `ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES` and, under Allow in the box below, click `Full Control`
5. Press `Apply` (PERFORM THIS LAST SOLUTION AT YOUR OWN RISK) 

This gives downloaded apps from the Store complete access to your computer. App will start and then you can just remove the ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES and app will still work.
