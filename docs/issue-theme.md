# Tray icon is too dark

Usually when you never change Windows theme, the system does not have the state of the current theme. You need to update state manually

### Solution

1. Go to `settings` -> `personalization` -> `colors`
2. Change `dark` to `light` theme or vice versa
3. Set a theme that you like

Now the app icon will update correctly depending on your theme.
